                    <h2>Abstract</h2>

                    <p>The quality of US television has received a substantial boost in recent years. Shows like <span class="work-title">Breaking Bad</span>, <span class="work-title">The Wire</span> and <span class="work-title">Mad Men</span> blossom into enjoyment, analysis and discussion like good literature – they have been called “film novels” repeatedly.</p>

                    <p>However, the better part of the discussions deals with content rather than form, disregarding the fact that besides the legitimately praised writing and acting, the formal aspects carry this revolution. The new shows look and sound like film for the big screen. Content and form merge into a work of art, quality and quantity are not mutually exclusive anymore.</p>

                    <p><span class="work-title">Breaking Bad</span> was created at the heart of this historical turn and has set the bar for future TV dramas in several respects. This dissertation intends to promote the discussion and analysis of this evolving art form, thereby focusing on the soundtrack and its role in the narrative. Music and sound design in television have been traditionally less sophisticated compared to cinema. Analysis will prove that shows like <span class="work-title">Breaking Bad</span> demand rethinking.</p>

                    <p>Contemporary American auteur series break new ground contentwise as well as formally. They share the aesthetics of film and address extraordinarily complex topics, yet at the same time unfold their narration in a serially subdivided medium and submit to the underlying conditions of TV production. So to some extend they are hybrids, combining characteristics of both worlds. It is an art form on the move, still recent and therefore demands some kind of analysis beyond the established film literature.</p>

                    <p>There is a reasonable amount of publications researching auteur series in terms of visual and dramatic aspects, so this analysis will focus on a less covered ingredient: The sound track. Famous directors have credited it with up to 50&nbsp;% of how we perceive a movie.<a id="footnote-242-2-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-242-2">2</a> In the past, smaller budgets and shorter production cycles have caused TV's sound designs to be more pragmatic than artful when compared to motion pictures. Shows like <span class="work-title">Twin Peaks</span> have since established a new value of the format, and with that comes the justification for scholarly attention.</p>

                    <p><span class="work-title">The Sound of Breaking Bad</span> deals with the sound design and music of <span class="work-title">Breaking Bad</span> representative for the auteur series. This particular show is very well-suited as it is still recent, however concluded. First and foremost, it features interesting, masterfully crafted sound tracks that operate in many different ways and significantly contribute to the narrative.</p>

                    <p>A quick word on where it all began: This project started out as my Bachelor's dissertation in the summer of 2014. Two years later, I wanted to learn how web development works, so I took my paper and created a website around it. Then I decided to translate the German original text to English in order to make it accessible to more readers (and improve my language skills as a side effect). Soon after I started translating, it became clear that I could also considerably improve and condense it along the way. For those interested, you may download <a href="https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/~curdt/Boecker.pdf" class="external-link" target="_blank">my original thesis as a PDF</a> and find the source code of this website on <a href="https://github.com/nbckr/soundofbreakingbad" class="external-link" target="_blank">Github.</a></p>

                    <p>To accomplish a comprehensive analysis, I have scrutinized the whole series and, furthermore, selected films as references. Due to the show's running time of almost 50 hours, this was never intended as a detailed low-level analysis. Rather, I tried to extract the essence from the big picture, the common thread running through the whole work.</p>

                    <p>Many observations are based on statements of the filmmakers behind <span class="work-title">Breaking Bad</span>, found in interviews, podcasts, audio comments and featurettes. A lot of insight could be gained by studying a dozen original original scripts that have been leaked or published. In addition, I have read the German standard works on matters of film music and sound design.</p>

                    <p>To create a complete picture of the sound and its part of the whole, we will first review the process of creating <span class="work-title">Breaking Bad</span>. Subsequently, we will individually study the music and the sound design. But of course you are free to jump in at any part and just read what seems valuable to you. It is not a requirement, but of course you will benefit most from this when you have actually seen the show or at least you're familiar with the plot. Obviously, this is loaded with spoilers.</p>

                    <p>It's in the nature of scientific observations to disassemble the object of interest, study the components and their relations in order to understand the whole. Therein lies a paradox, as the individual parts by themselves do not have the same effect as they do in the context of an audio-visual entirety. It is the dismemberment of a unit and does not go along with the intentions of the filmmakers to take us on a journey and capture us in a coherent stream of images and sounds. And yet we have to break the spell and press 'pause', as only by virtue of this distance and closer inspection we can gain a deeper understanding of the manifold mechanisms of an excellent sound design. Eventually, this understanding will also help us understand the huge success of the auteur series and the magic of filmmaking itself.</p>
