                    <h2 id="title">Main title theme</h2>

                    <p>The title music of a series should have the highest recognition value possible and capture the essence of the series musically. The difficulty, however, is that it has to get created before the bulk of the series:</p>
                    <blockquote>Doing a theme is really tough for a TV show because when you create it, you’ve only seen the pilot. And of course you want the theme to represent the show as a whole — before the show has even been built.<a id="footnote-242-13-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-242-13">13</a></blockquote>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>What I did know was that (Breaking Bad creator) Vince Gilligan had said the backbone of the story was the slow devolution of Walter White, taking this milquetoast guy and turning him into a cold and hardened criminal. With that in mind, when I created the theme I wanted it to give a glimpse of the end result of that journey, so that we are always reminded of the ultimate destination.</p>
                        <p>I tried many combinations of musical ideas, and the New Mexico landscape and discussions with Vince about Breaking Bad having aspects of a ‚post-modern western‘ were influential. The version that ultimately prevailed had a swagger and cold aggression about it that hopefully, particularly in the early seasons, pointed towards an even darker story.<a id="footnote-242-14-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-242-14">14</a></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Porter's 18-second „Breaking Bad Main Title Theme“ is based on a simple ⁴⁄₄ beat. The beat however gets swirled around and syncopated by percussion instruments, thus evoking the sense of a much more complex time signature.<a id="footnote-242-15-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-242-15">15</a>. The sound resembles bongos or similar hollow wooden instruments, whereas Porter has in fact produced the noise by hitting a gas can and subsequently adjusting the pitch electronically.<a id="footnote-242-16-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-242-16">16</a>. On the first beat, a hi-hat seems to get hit, and the same sound returns reversely at the end of the song, somewhat embracing the whole of it. The envelope of that reversed sound is now increasing and anticipative. The rhythmic patterns in general form a counter voice that orbit the actual melody.</p>

                    <p>The theme's motif gets played on a vibrantly plucked metallic resonator guitar. The notes are connected with glissandi, an effect that has been achieved with by sliding a so-called bottleneck over the strings.<a id="footnote-242-17-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-242-17">17</a>. The instrumentation and technique are reminiscent of western movies and evoke vast American desert landscapes. They have been famously used in that context by guitar player Ry Cooder in the score of <span class="work-title">Paris, Texas </span>(USA 1964, Wim Wenders) and many others since.</p>

                    <p>Porter's guitar theme gets replicated on a bass. At the end of the short piece however, the guitar track doesn't resolve its tension and return to the fundamental - it seems to get stuck in mid-air and the bass concludes the melodic arc unaccompanied. The bass and the rhythm section perform an accelerando, meaning they accelerate and intensify before they finally fall silent.<a id="footnote-242-18-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-242-18">18</a>. As a concequence, we feel a subtle discrepancy between the subsiding melody and the relucting rhythmics.</p>

                    <p>Furthermore, throughout the whole piece we can discern some sound objects that are hard to express in words. Even though they are abstract and untraceable, they descriptively mimic the visuals:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>high-frequency, falling shimmer ≈ emergence and disappearance of elements of the periodic table
                        <li>„Whoosh“-sounds ≈ the <span class="work-title">Breaking Bad</span> logo emerges from the cosmos of vague visual elements</li>
                        <li>Sound of a bell (sleigh bell?) ≈ the remaining letters appear</li>
                        <li>crackling ≈ suggests a burning cigarette</li>
                        <li>Wind noise ≈ smoke</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After rhythm and melody have terminated, the other sound elements disappear as the last clouds of smoke vanish from the screen. However, another sound emerges without any visual equivalent: A repeating sample of wooden claves, an onomatopoeic appendix evoking a rattlesnake and gently drifting away like reverberation of the song.</p>

                    <p>The semantic charge of the instrumentation and the onomatopoeic mimicry evoke images in our heads: „It gives the impression of the desert at night, with unseen creatures lurking just underfoot.“<a id="footnote-242-19-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-242-19">19</a> However, everything happens so fast that we may only process all these small details subconsciously, if at all. When compared with the composed music within the episodes, this piece still stands out for its consistency, melody and tangibility. Even though it is atypical in that sense, it does anticipate a great deal of what will later on define Porter's style of composition in the show, most importantly the integrative use of noises.</p>

                    <p>The piece starts out loud, sudden and fulminant, thus making a clean break and in many cases roughly disrupting the flow of the story. This momentum and the narrative's tension enhance and mutually amplify each other. The teaser is often surprising, unexpected, random or out of place. Story and music build up some tension and at the climax, the opening credits and Porter's forceful theme burst in as if they wanted to bring the show back on track and end the experimental and confusing first part single-handedly.<a id="footnote-242-20-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-242-20">20</a></p>

                    <p>While working on the second season, Porter has created an extended version of the theme that has been published on the corresponding soundtrack album<a id="footnote-242-21-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-242-21">21</a>. This version runs one minute longer than the original. It starts with the same two notes, but subsequently shifts down a gear and continues with a variation of the motif. A marimba-like instrument repeatedly plays short patterns, the music gradually gains in density and intensity, heads towards its climax and ultimately discharges itself in the actual main theme. For some time, it was considered to use this track at the end of Season 4 after Walter's victory over Gus. Gilligan didn't know at the time whether there would be a fifth season and therefore wanted to end the season on a potentially final note while also keeping his options open.<a id="footnote-242-22-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-242-22">22</a> In the end, the decision was made not to use the song as it would have felt too much like closure.<a id="footnote-242-23-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-242-23">23</a> The piece did finally find its way into the penultimate installment of the series, 5x15 <span class="work-title">Granite State</span>.</p>

                    <p>Walter is in New Hampshire and has finally reached rock bottom. His brother-in-law is dead, his family has turned away from him and does not even accept his money, his partner has betrayed him and he is one of America's most wanted criminals. Completely resigned, he calls the police and gives his location away. Then he sits down at the counter of a small pub and orders a whiskey. Upon seeing his former colleagues publicly disowning him on TV however, he changes his mind and escapes yet again.</p>

                    <p>While this change of heart unfolds, the music gradually emerges. It begins as a low-pitched, indeterminate swirling. As Walter's emotions change, so does the tune. The marimba-like subject of the extended version of the theme comes in, and the music pushes all other noises into the background. As the camera pans to the episode's final image, the music jumps from the variation to the bold original theme and the screen fades to black.</p>

                    <p>At the beginning of the scene, we, the viewers, are alienated from the protagonist. After all the horrors of the preceding 5x14 <span class="work-title">Ozymandias</span> we rarely identify with him any more, there is only dread and pity. But then we get drawn back into his head imperceptibly. How does the show accomplish that?</p>

                    <p>The usage of the theme provokes a strong emotional reaction as we all know it by now and identify it with the series as a whole. All fans that have been following Walter White's descent over the course of 61 episodes get collectivized. Depending on whether the viewer recognizes the middle part of the extended version or just senses some similarity with the main theme, at some point a new identification process starts to creep in. The aforementioned volume, immediacy and force of the music, especially as it comes towards its end, also contribute their share. Above all however it is the meaning we have implicitly charged the music with by hearing it over and over again. Like Porter had intended to, it always seemed to have foreshadowed where the journey would finally lead. And now, it feels as though we have arrived. It is an iconic and confident scene: At the musical and narrative climax, we don't even see the main character, we only see his half-full glass as a symbol denoting that he is not done yet. Other than that, it's the music that fills up the empty space. It steps out from the shadows, comes out into the open and wants to be heard. It sends shivers down the spines of the fans that have been following the story for up to five years. None of them will want to miss out on the final episode. We are now ready to join Walter on his arc's final metres.</p>

                    <p>In some ways, the concerns the creators had about placing this song at the end of Season 4 realised, albeit the effect seems appropriate at this late point of the story. The song delimits what has happened before and offers some closure. It is fair to say that 5x16 <span class="work-title">Felina</span> seems a bit like an epilogue to the tragedy that has began in <span class="work-title">Pilot</span> and found its fiery peak in 5x14 <span class="work-title">Ozymandias</span>.</p>

                    <p>The first season mostly used licenced songs to conclude episodes, starting within the episode and transitioning into the end credits. Starting from the second season, distinct composed pieces of music got played over the end credits. This change has been strongly influenced by AMC's decision not to air the credits, or mute them and show other content while they run in a corner of the screen. Hence, Porter wrote these songs exclusively for later distribution. A little bonus for the fans.</p>

                    <p>In the production phases of these seasons, Porter wrote a new 22-second score for the end credits each week. Every piece is a variation of the main theme - some more obvious, some really abstract. Either the established melody gets played on another instrument or the distorted original recording is hidden in the mix. Sometimes the affinity merely comprises syncopated rhythms similar to the title theme. For composer Dave Porter, these tracks were the only ones he didn't have to tailor to fit the visuals.</p>

                    <p>At the spotting sessions, the end credits have been approached like any other scene. Gilligan and Porter discussed, with which feelings they wanted to release the viewers.<a id="footnote-242-24-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-242-24">24</a> Mostly, the short pieces capture the essence of the episode holistically, giving what happens at the end of the episode more weight however. For instance, 5x5 <span class="work-title">Dead Freight</span> consists largely of a suspense-packed train robbery. It surprisingly ends on a sad note, when an innocent child gets murdered in the fourth act, and consequently the closing credits are mournful and gloomy. Episodes that end on a cliffhanger are mostly followed by a fast-paced, anticipative track. Generally speaking, the end credits are inscrutable and dark, therefore they fall into line with the whole of Porter's Breaking Bad oeuvre.</p>

                    <p>In 13 cases, noises that play an important part in an episode have been built into its end credits. Porter contacted Forshager to send him the sound files.<a id="footnote-242-25-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-242-25">25</a> That way, he pushed forward his philosophy of blurring the lines between music and sound design and also added to the symbolization of these particular sounds. By extracting sounds and lifting them out of the regular audio track, they get decontextualized and thus more perceptible. Taking centre stage like that, they provoke thought and get charged with meaning and symbolic value. In fact, they are elevated to key sounds, if they haven't been already. None more so than Héctor's bell, which hasn't only been used in the end credits twice, but also had an important role to play within the diegesis.</p>

                    <p>The recurrent use of a title sequence and end credits alone provide the skeleton of the show. By revisiting the same melody at the end of the episode, these two units enframe the action inbetween. Since many people nowadays binge-watch shows rather than digesting them one by one, this inherent structure is the break that allows us to take a breath and acknowledge the serial nature of the narration.</p>
