                    <p>The aim of this work was to work out the role of music and sound in <span class="work-title">Breaking Bad</span>, one of the most important contemporary American auteur series. To this end, the show has been critically analyzed, compared with other cinematographic works, and correlated with common scientific literature on this topic. On several levels, the analysis provided interesting findings.</p>

                    <p>Even though the sound track inherently operates in secret and doesn't catch our attention most of the time, in <span class="work-title">Breaking Bad</span> it is elaborately constructed and doesn't need to shy away from comparisons with film for the big screen. It supports the narrative, it contributes hidden symbolism and semantic content, it captivates us with its emotionalizing tactics. It even makes us root for characters that act contrary to our moral values. Speech, noises, music and silence go hand in hand and complement each other to create a powerful viewing experience.</p>

                    <p><span class="work-title">The Sound of Breaking Bad</span> is meant to examine these invisible forces, take a look into the toolbox of this artful TV series and reveal the treasures within. I also consider it a source of inspiration for composers, sound designers, directors etc. who want to use the achievements of a great show in their own work.</p>

                    <p>The strategies and techniques used, strictly speaking, aren't really new. However, they are convincing because they are applied with such skilled craftsmanship. What is more, in the given context of a TV show they <em>are</em> innovative to some extent. That's because the sound design of television productions has lagged behind that of cinema for a long time. Series like <span class="work-title">Breaking Bad</span> changed that and gave the sound track the attention it deserves to take full effect. It can be assumed that this high-class sound design is one of the reasons why contemporary American auteur series enjoy such a high reputation, attract famous actors and creatives, and boast financial success.</p>

                    <p>In the process of creation, the makers of <span class="work-title">Breaking Bad</span> have shown an exemplary communication on all levels. A lot of auditive elements have been weaved into the plot as early as in the screenplays. The so-called spotting sessions provided a forum for exchange between composer, music supervisor, sound designer and show runner.</p>

                    <p>Speaking of the show runner: Vince Gilligan's vision run's through the complete work like a thread. The creator, head writer, executive producer, and sometimes director was involved in every stage of production and served as the interface between the sound department and the rest of the team, thus giving the whole show his personal touch. This is one of the main reasons why a media product produced over such long periods of time could possess remarkably coherent and consistent tonal style. Although we see a series episodically produced over a number of years, we perceive it as a homogeneous work with a seamless author voice. Therefore, the term 'auteur series' is thoroughly legitimate.</p>

                    <p>The overall conclusion is that the sound design and music of <span class="work-title">Breaking Bad</span> are really well-made and for a foreseeable future, new TV shows will have to measure up to them. If we assume that the phenomenon 'Quality TV' is self-reinforcing since high-quality productions imply popular success and vice versa, it will be interesting to see what the future holds for us. The expectations are high.</p>
